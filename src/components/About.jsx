          Ralph Gibson, born on January 16, 1939, in Hollywood, California, is a revered American photographer renowned for his surrealistic black-and-white images. The son of the Hollywood film industry (his father was an assistant director to Alfred Hitchcock), Gibson's early exposure to film sets ignited his passion for photography. He studied photography during his tenure in the U.S. Navy and furthered his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute. Gibson's professional journey began as an assistant to iconic photographer Dorothea Lange in San Francisco, and later, he assisted on several of Robert Frank's films.
